                    <div>
                        <div class="body-bio"><p>Hello, I’d like to take a brief moment to introduce myself and how I arrived at this point. Althouhg recently upskilling in coding My university training is in the social-sciences. I have a Politics and Economics BSc
                            and an International Politics MSc.</p>
                            <p>During my MSc I studied code and its ever growing effect upon all aspects of our lives. It drove me to upskill in coding, for professional reasons as it complimented my degrees (and is in demand), but also because digital systems intrigue me.
                           I’ve always enjoyed maths and problems solving and coding has come naturally. I’ve enjoyed completing the courses I have taken. The continual problem solving and lateral thinking that is required to be a good developer engages all my skills
                            and I am looking forward to developing myself and my career in the industry.</p>
                           <p>My coding journey has had some challenges. After finishing my MSc my priority became looking after my father, who was suffering from dementia, which was my focus until he died during the pandemic. I’ve been working in my old
                            profession as a chef whilst training. A slightly longer path has led to well developed and <span style="font-style:italic;">usable</span> knowledge, my problem solving skills have also been continually developing and I feel primed for a professional role.
                             I am incredibly eager to apply myself to my next challenge and it would be great to talk about any opportunities that we could work on together.</p>
