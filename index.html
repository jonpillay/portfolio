                    <div>
                        <div class="body-bio"><p>Hello, I’d like to take a moment to introduce myself. I background in the social sciences, with a Politics and Economics BSc and an MSc in International Politics.</p>
                            <p>During my master's degree I studied code and its ever growing effect upon all aspects of our lives, it became the driver for me learning computer science.
                            I’ve always enjoyed maths and problem solving and coding has come naturally. I’ve enjoyed completing the courses I have taken and the challenges involved. The continual problem solving and lateral thinking that is required to be a
                            good developer engages all my skills and I am looking forward to developing myself and my career in the industry.</p>
                           <p>After finishing my MSc my priority became looking after my father, who was suffering from dementia, which was my focus until his passing during the pandemic. I’ve been working in my old
                            profession as a chef whilst learning. A slightly longer path has led to well developed and <span style="font-style:italic;">usable</span> knowledge, my problem solving skills have also been continually developing. It would be great
                             for me to continue progressing along my path in a professional role with a team. I am incredibly eager to apply myself to my next challenge and it would be great to talk about any opportunities that we could work on together.</p>

                                Professional history working as a chef, in and leading, tight and well organised teams in high pressure, short deadline environments - I like the heat. I’ve worked as a data analyst for the ‘Solicitor Regulation Authority’ looking
                                into descrimination based on race with Prof. Gus John - I like numbers. I’ve worked as a student journalist and then led the team as the Editor-In-Chief - I'm a great communicator. I enjoy swimming, surfing, hiking, reading, computer
                                 games, and growingly VR (random fact and geek confession: I used to dream about strapping CRTs to my face whilst my C64 loaded) - I'm a bit of a nerd.
